# Pain-t-
Ellis's Pain(t) Version 1.0

New Features:


*Program Now Exists

*Can Load a chosen Image file through the File menu

*Can Save the current loaded Image file through the File menu

*Can Exit the program through the File menu

*A scroll bar is implemented when the image size exceeds the window



Known Issues:


*No major issues so far, but the image seems to hug the left side of the window and I'm not sure why


Expected Next Sprint:


*Will allow the user to both Save and Save As

*Will allow the user to draw on and edit the image

*Will load a blank image on startup to draw on

*Will (hopefully) implement a zoom feature

*Will be able to select and change colors
